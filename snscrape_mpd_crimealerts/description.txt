Employed MapBox API to generate streetmap of DC to visualize one year's MPD crime alerts following the high-publicity mass shooting on R Street in June. 

The project was started with the objective of mapping the locations of incidents around the city that are tweeted out by MPD.

Scraped MPD tweets with keyword "alert" using snscrape package.

Used GEOJSON as mapping format. Used JS to mark incident locations as Twitter-blue circles.

Failed attempt at making the blue circles bird icons.
